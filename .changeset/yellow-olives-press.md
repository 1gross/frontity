Republish the `@frontity/yoast` package
([feature discussion](https://community.frontity.org/t/support-for-yoast-plugin-rest-api-fields/2626)).

This new version is compatible with WordPress sites using the
[Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) plugin since its
version 14.0.

The old
[`@frontity/yoast`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontity/yoast/v/1.2.0)
package was deprecated in favor of the
[`@frontity/head-tags`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@frontity/head-tags)
package for WordPress sites using also the
[REST API - Head Tags](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api-head-tags/)
plugin, but that plugin is not compatible with recent versions of Yoast SEO.
