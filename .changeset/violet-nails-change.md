We have made easier to work with searches and pagination by adding:

- `data.link` in all entities.
- `data.isSearch` in searches.
- `data.searchQuery` in searches.
- `data.page` in archives.
- `data.next` which points to the next page in an archive.
- `data.previous` which points to the previous page in an archive.
