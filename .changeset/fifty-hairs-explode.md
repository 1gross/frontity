Change the name of entity types and add new ones:

- Change `PostType` to `PostEntity`
- Append `Entity` to all other entity types.
- Add `PostType` and `TaxonomyType` for the objects that represent entity types. From WordPress, those types come from `/wp/v2/types` and `wp/v2/taxonomies` endpoints respectively.
