# » What is Frontity?

**Frontity** can be explained in two different ways:

1. As an alternative rendering engine for WordPress.
1. As a React framework to create WordPress themes.

Both are true :)

## 1. An alternative rendering engine for WordPress

In the past the only way to get HTML out of WordPress was to use its **PHP rendering engine**. Quite an old friend, isn't it? ;)

But in WordPress 4.7 the [**WP API**](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) was included in the core.

> _An API is a protocol to retrieve content from an external service._

Thanks to the **WP API**, developers are not longer limited to the **PHP rendering engine**. They can retrieve their WordPress content and use it wherever they want. A new world of possibilities started.

One of those possibilities is to create WordPress themes using React. That's where **Frontity** comes into play.

## 2. A React framework to create WordPress themes

[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) is a super powerful library for building user interfaces. It was created by **Facebook** and is taking over front-end development.

But, in spite of how amazing it is, React is just **a JavaScript library, not a framework**. It does not assume anything about the other parts in any full solution. It focuses on just one thing, and on doing that thing very well.

In order to create a WordPress theme with React developers need to learn and configure a lots of different things: _bundling, transpiling, routing, server rendering, retrieving data from WordPress, managing state, managing css, linting, testing..._

**There is a reason React frameworks exist**. For example, [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [GatbsyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) are two amazing React frameworks. Both _can_ work with WordPress, but are not focused on WordPress. Therefore, there's still some configuration and additional tooling left to the developer.

[**Frontity**](https://frontity.org), on the other hand, is an **opinionated React framework focused on WordPress**:

- **Opinionated framework:** developers don't need to figure out what tools to use for things like css or state management.
- **Focused on WordPress:** each part of the framework has been simplified and optimized to be used with WordPress.

This means everything is already patched and working so you can start creating your new amazing WordPress theme with React right away! 🎉🚀

# » How does it work?

With **Frontity**, WordPress become a **Headless CMS**.

> _A [Headless CMS](https://css-tricks.com/what-is-a-headless-cms/) is a content management system that makes the content accessible via an API._

Editors can keep creating their content in the WordPress dashboard, but the front-end (the theme) is rendered by Frontity in an external Node.js server:

## Why a Node.js server?

## Why React?

## Why Frontity?

## Whos's behind?

We are a small team of people who

### Fully Decoupled React Themes

It uses NodeJS (and not PHP) to create the final server rendered HTML.

### WP Rest API

- **Frontity** is **extensible**. Right now we have extensions like _Disqus comments, OneSignal notifications, Adsense, Doubleclick, SmartAds, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Custom CSS or Custom HTML_. This means, your Frontity Theme won't have to reinvent the wheel each time including stuff than can be outsourced to extensions.

### 🚀 It is Lightning Fast

The Frontity's render engine also supports **AMP** html. This means you can reuse your React and CSS code to create your AMP pages.
