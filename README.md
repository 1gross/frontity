# » What is Frontity?

**Frontity** can be explained in two different ways:

1. As an alternative rendering engine for WordPress.
1. As a React framework to create WordPress themes.

Both are true :)

## 1. An alternative rendering engine for WordPress

In the past the only way to get HTML out of WordPress was to use its **PHP rendering engine**. Quite an old friend, isn't it? ;)

But in WordPress 4.7 the [**WP API**](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/) was included in the core.

> _An API is a protocol to retrieve content from an external service._

Thanks to the **WP API**, developers are not longer limited to the **PHP rendering engine**. They can retrieve their WordPress content and use it wherever they want. A new world of possibilities started.

One of those possibilities is to create WordPress themes using React. That's where **Frontity** comes into play.

## 2. A React framework to create WordPress themes

[**React**](https://reactjs.org/) is a super powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was created by **Facebook** and is taking over front-end development.

But, in spite of how amazing it is, **React** is just a UI library. If you want to create a WordPress theme you still need to configure a lots of things: _bundling, transpiling, routing, state management, server rendering, linting, testing..._ **There is a reason React frameworks exist :)**

There are others, like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [GatbsyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). Both are amazing tools and they _can_ work with WordPress, but there's still a lot configuration needed.

[**Frontity**](https://frontity.org), on the other hand, it is **focused in WordPress**. This means everything is already patched and working so you can start creating your new amazing WordPress theme with React, right away! 🎉

# » How does it work?

## Why a Node.js server?

## Why React?

## Why Frontity?

## Whos's behind?

### Fully Decoupled React Themes

It uses NodeJS (and not PHP) to create the final server rendered HTML.

### WP Rest API

- **Frontity** is **extensible**. Right now we have extensions like _Disqus comments, OneSignal notifications, Adsense, Doubleclick, SmartAds, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Custom CSS or Custom HTML_. This means, your Frontity Theme won't have to reinvent the wheel each time including stuff than can be outsourced to extensions.

### 🚀 It is Lightning Fast

The Frontity's render engine also supports **AMP** html. This means you can reuse your React and CSS code to create your AMP pages.
