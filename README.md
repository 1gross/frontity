## » How it works «

### Fully Decoupled React Themes

It uses NodeJS (and not PHP) to create the final server rendered HTML.

### WP Rest API

It uses the **WP REST API** to fetch content from WordPress.

- **Frontity** is **extensible**. Right now we have extensions like _Disqus comments, OneSignal notifications, Adsense, Doubleclick, SmartAds, Google Analytics, Google Tag Manager, Custom CSS or Custom HTML_. This means, your Frontity Theme won't have to reinvent the wheel each time including stuff than can be outsourced to extensions.

## » The Features «

### 🚀 It is Lightning Fast

The Frontity's render engine also supports **AMP** html. This means you can reuse your React and CSS code to create your AMP pages.
